# Coffee-Mashine-Using-Pyhon
This Python project simulates a coffee machine, offering options like espresso, latte, and cappuccino. Users select a coffee type, and the program manages ingredient levels (water, milk, coffee beans), processes payments, and alerts if supplies run low. It uses functions, loops, and conditionals to create an interactive coffee-making experience.
